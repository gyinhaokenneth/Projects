    "# Problem Statement \n",
    "The pet training centre has been experiencing high call and visit volumes by pet owners who seek advice from staff when they need help in handling their pets (cats and dogs in particular) as the current chatbot was not giving relevant information to the customers. Such behaviour results in a waste of manpower resources as the staff had to spend a huge part of their time speaking with pet owners at the centre or over the phone. If the chatbot was able to classify the enquiries accurately and provide relevant information, the bulk of the enquiries could be handled automatically.\n",
